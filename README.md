## 🎯 What is an NFT Auction?

### Simple Explanation (Like You're 5)

Imagine you have a rare Pokemon card:
- You want to sell it
- You say: "Starting at $10, auction ends in 24 hours"
- Your friends bid: $15, $20, $25...
- After 24 hours, highest bidder wins
- They get the card, you get the money

**NFT Auction = Same thing, but with digital items!**

---

## 📦 Deploy Smart Contracts

### What You're Deploying

You'll deploy 2 smart contracts:

1. **SimpleNFT.sol** - Creates NFTs for testing
2. **NFTAuction.sol** - Handles auctions

### Prerequisites

✅ Node.js installed (v18+)  
✅ MetaMask wallet  
✅ Test funds (get from faucet)  

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Get Test Funds (2 minutes)

Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- Enter your wallet address
- Click "Give me BNB"
- Wait 1 minute
- ✅ You have 0.5 tBNB

#### 2. Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

Wait for packages to install...

#### 3. Configure Environment (2 minutes)

```bash
# Create .env file
cp env-example.txt .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your private key:

```bash
# Get private key from MetaMask:
# Settings → Security & Privacy → Show Private Key

PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never share your private key!

#### 4. Deploy to Testnet (3 minutes)

```bash
npm run deploy:testnet
```

You'll see:
```
✅ SimpleNFT deployed to: 0xABC123...
✅ NFTAuction deployed to: 0xDEF456...
✅ Minted 3 test NFTs
```

**🎉 Success! Your contracts are live!**

#### 5. Update App (1 minute)

Open `lib/services/auction_service.dart` and update:

```dart
// Line 10
static const String auctionContractAddress = '0xDEF456...';

// Line 11
static const String nftContractAddress = '0xABC123...';
```

Replace with YOUR actual addresses from deployment!

---

## 🎮 How to Use Auctions

### Complete Workflow

#### **Step 1: Mint an NFT** (if you don't have one)

You already have 3 NFTs minted during deployment!

To mint more:
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat console --network bnbTestnet
```

```javascript
const nft = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleNFT", "YOUR_NFT_ADDRESS");
await nft.mintNFT(deployer.address, "ipfs://test/metadata.json");
console.log("NFT minted!");
```

#### **Step 2: Approve Auction Contract**

Before creating auction, approve the contract:

```javascript
// In hardhat console
await nft.approve("YOUR_AUCTION_ADDRESS", 1);
console.log("Approved Token ID 1");
```

#### **Step 3: Create Auction** (In Your App!)

1. Open app → Auctions tab
2. Tap "Create Auction" tab
3. Fill the form:
   ```
   NFT Contract Address: 0xABC123... (paste yours)
   Token ID: 1
   Starting Price: 0.1
   Duration: 24
   ```
4. Tap "Create Auction"
5. Approve in MetaMask
6. Wait for confirmation
7. ✅ Auction created!

#### **Step 4: View Auction**

1. Tap "Active Auctions" tab
2. See your auction listed
3. Share with friends to bid!

#### **Step 5: Place Bid**

1. Find auction in "Active Auctions"
2. Tap "Place Bid" button
3. Enter amount (must be higher than current bid)
4. Tap "Place Bid"
5. Approve in MetaMask
6. ✅ Your bid is placed!

#### **Step 6: End Auction** (after time expires)

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat console --network bnbTestnet
```

```javascript
const auction = await ethers.getContractAt("NFTAuction", "YOUR_AUCTION_ADDRESS");
await auction.endAuction(0);  // 0 is the auction ID
console.log("Auction ended!");
```

#### **Step 7: Withdraw Payment** (for seller)

```javascript
await auction.withdraw();
console.log("Payment withdrawn!");
```

## 🎬 Real Example: Your First Auction

Let's create a real auction together!

### Scenario: You Want to Sell NFT #1

**What you need:**
- ✅ Wallet connected
- ✅ Contracts deployed
- ✅ At least 0.05 tBNB for gas fees
- ✅ NFT Token ID 1 (already minted)

**Let's do it:**

#### 1. Approve NFT (1 minute)

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat console --network bnbTestnet
```

```javascript
// Replace with YOUR addresses
const nft = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleNFT", "0xYOUR_NFT_ADDRESS");
await nft.approve("0xYOUR_AUCTION_ADDRESS", 1);

// Wait for this message:
// ✅ Transaction confirmed
```

#### 2. Create Auction via Console (1 minute)

```javascript
const auction = await ethers.getContractAt("NFTAuction", "0xYOUR_AUCTION_ADDRESS");

await auction.createAuction(
  "0xYOUR_NFT_ADDRESS",     // NFT contract
  1,                         // Token ID
  ethers.parseEther("0.1"),  // Start at 0.1 ETH
  86400                      // 24 hours (in seconds)
);

// Wait for confirmation...
// ✅ Auction created! ID: 0
```

#### 3. Check Auction Details (30 seconds)

```javascript
const details = await auction.getAuction(0);
console.log("Seller:", details[0]);
console.log("Start Price:", ethers.formatEther(details[3]));
console.log("Current Bid:", ethers.formatEther(details[4]));
console.log("End Time:", new Date(Number(details[6]) * 1000));
```

#### 4. Place a Bid (1 minute)

```javascript
// Bid 0.15 ETH
await auction.placeBid(0, { value: ethers.parseEther("0.15") });

// ✅ Bid placed!
```

#### 5. Check Who's Winning (30 seconds)

```javascript
const details = await auction.getAuction(0);
console.log("Highest Bidder:", details[5]);
console.log("Highest Bid:", ethers.formatEther(details[4]));
```

#### 6. After 24 Hours - End Auction (1 minute)

```javascript
await auction.endAuction(0);
// ✅ Auction ended!
// NFT sent to winner
// Payment sent to seller
```

#### 7. Withdraw Payment (30 seconds)

```javascript
// Check how much you can withdraw
const pending = await auction.pendingWithdrawals(deployer.address);
console.log("You can withdraw:", ethers.formatEther(pending), "ETH");

// Withdraw it
await auction.withdraw();
// ✅ Payment received!
```

**🎉 Complete! You just ran a full NFT auction!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Deployment failed

**Error: "Insufficient funds"**
```bash
# Get more test funds
Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
```

**Error: "Invalid private key"**
```bash
# Check your .env file
# Make sure private key has NO "0x" prefix
# Example: abc123def456... (NOT 0xabc123def456...)
```

### Problem: Can't create auction

**Error: "Contract not approved"**
```javascript
// Approve first
const nft = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleNFT", "NFT_ADDRESS");
await nft.approve("AUCTION_ADDRESS", TOKEN_ID);
```

**Error: "You don't own this NFT"**
```javascript
// Check who owns it
const owner = await nft.ownerOf(TOKEN_ID);
console.log("Owner:", owner);
console.log("Your address:", deployer.address);
```

### Problem: Can't place bid

**Error: "Bid not high enough"**
- Your bid must be higher than current bid
- Add at least 0.01 ETH more

**Error: "Auction has ended"**
- Check time remaining first
- Can't bid on ended auctions

### Problem: MetaMask not opening

**Solution:**
1. Make sure MetaMask mobile is installed
2. Try opening MetaMask manually
3. Check for pending transactions
4. Approve or reject them
